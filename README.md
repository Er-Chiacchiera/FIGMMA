# Surf-Training

Surf-Training is a web application built with SpringBoot, Bootstrap, and Postgres. The project aims to manage the FIGMMA federation, showcasing the various teams and athletes regularly registered with the federation.

The system is designed so that any user, even if not registered, can view the homepage. Registered users have free access to various pages to view all the teams with their respective athletes, and all athletes who currently have or do not have a valid contract with a team.

Registration in the system can be done through the registration system we have implemented.

The system includes various functionalities:

- For users:
  - View their own profile
  - View teams
  - View athlete profiles

- For administrators:
  - All functionalities listed above for users
  - Add, modify, and delete teams
  - Add, modify, and delete athletes

- For presidents:
  - All functionalities listed above for users
  - Add and delete athlete contracts

The project was developed by:
